# matrixClass

This C++ class holds a standard library vector in A^(n*m) space, where the set A can be: Z the set of integers, N the set of natural number, R the set of real Numbers. With this class you can perform the usual overloaded binary operations necessary for matrix arithmetic (e.g. +,-,*).
